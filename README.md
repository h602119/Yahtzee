# Optimal Predictor Machine (OPM) for Yahtzee

This is a semester project for ADA511, where we build an Optimal Predictor Machine (OPM) for the game Yahtzee. The OPM aims to simulate and predict optimal moves to achieve the best possible outcomes in the game.

## Project Overview

The project simulates the game in two main parts:

1. **Equal Dice Strategy**: In this phase, the machine attempts to achieve the highest end result possible with identical dice values.
2. **Combination Strategies**: This part focuses on achieving specific Yahtzee combinations, such as "Full House," "Large Straight," "Yahtzee," and others.

## Goals

The objective is to:

- Develop a simulation model for Yahtzee that can assess various game strategies.
- Create an algorithm that predicts the optimal moves to maximize the score.
